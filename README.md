# RoTrace
Roblox with Raytracing Using Cuda and Hooks
# About
## THIS WILL NOT ADD RAYTRACING TO YOUR GAME
This is POC code to show how it would be done by edit the renderer there is not a raytracing cuda script!

## When and Where

When would this script work? It would work if you able to look at the roblox source and edit the game rendering. This is not a normal case!
